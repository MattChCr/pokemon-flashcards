## Notes

I had a lot of trouble figuring out displaying only one part of the pair of information for the flashcards, it was difficult to pinpoint where the function creating the changes should lie, whether in the component or the app. The other main challenge I had was passing through a background color for each flashcard. Having dynamic class names was the easiest solution for me in the end as I was struggling with passing a color code from a dicionary in the div styling.
